# Ayush Shrivastava

Tech Lead at redBus, building Android systems at scale. I work on problems that sit at the intersection of mobile architecture, developer tooling, and increasingly, AI-powered automation. Most of my time goes into designing resilient systems, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, and exploring how LLMs can augment engineering workflows.

## What I Work On

**Android Architecture & Systems**  
Deep experience with Jetpack Compose, custom rendering pipelines, and performance optimization for apps serving 50M+ users. I've built everything from real-time bus tracking systems to shader-based visual effects using OpenGL ES and AGSL.

**Developer Experience & Tooling**  
Established CI/CD infrastructure from scratch (Jenkins, GitLab) that reduced release cycles by 80%. I care about making builds fast, deployments predictable, and developer feedback loops tight.

**AI & Agentic Systems**  
Experimenting with LangChain, LangGraph, and structured data extraction. Built ParserGPT—an LLM-powered tool that converts messy web content into clean CSVs, featured by the LangChain team. Interested in how agents can handle real-world parsing, reasoning, and workflow automation.

**Graphics & Rendering**  
Authored OpenGLShaderKit, an Android library combining OpenGL ES, AGSL, and ARCore for visual effects in Compose. Covers liquid glass effects, parallax, magnifiers, and AR integration—useful for anyone building custom UI beyond what the framework provides.

## Selected Work

**[OpenGLShaderKit](https://github.com/ayush016/OpenGLShaderKit)**  
Production-ready Android library for shader-based effects and AR experiences in Jetpack Compose. Demonstrates low-level graphics knowledge, API design, and real-world performance constraints.

**[Handwritten](https://github.com/ayush016/Handwritten)**  
Converts digital text into handwriting. Built with Flask, hosted on GCP. 30K+ downloads, top 3 search result for "handwritten" on Play Store. Shows end-to-end ownership: backend, deployment, user acquisition.

**[ParserGPT](https://medium.com/@ayush.shrivastava016)**  
AI-powered web scraper that turns unstructured HTML into structured CSVs using LangChain abstractions. Featured by LangChain on LinkedIn/Twitter for practical applicability. Explores semantic parsing, schema alignment, and LLM reasoning limits.

**[RoomJetpackCompose](https://github.com/ayush016/RoomJetpackCompose)**  
Clean architecture reference for CRUD operations with Room + Kotlin Flow + Compose. Useful for teams adopting modern Android patterns.

## Writing

I write technical deep-dives on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ayush.shrivastava016)—mostly about Android internals, architecture decisions, and AI tooling. The goal is to explain how things work under the hood, not just how to use them. If you're debugging a complex system or evaluating tradeoffs, you'll find something useful.

## Background

Currently Tech Lead at redBus (MakeMyTrip), where I manage a team of 4 engineers and own technical direction for features across Android. Delivered 50+ large-scale features over the past few years, from new business verticals to payment integrations. Pursuing a part-time MS in Computer Science at Georgia Tech while working full-time.

Previously interned at Samsung R&D (AppCore team) and redBus, where I built automation tools and GPS device quality analysis systems that influenced hardware upgrade decisions.

## Currently

Doubling down on agentic systems and exploring how LLMs can move beyond chat interfaces into structured workflows—parsing, data transformation, and multi-step reasoning. Also deepening knowledge in distributed systems and compiler design through grad coursework.

Open to collaborating on projects that involve production-scale Android challenges, developer tooling, or practical AI applications. If you're working on something in this space, let's talk.
